<font size ="2", color="orange"><p><b>For paragraph 1</b> I am using the font element with the "name" color attribute.
I have chose the color orange for this example. I am curious as to which color names are accepted to specify color.
Would maroon or sage work?<u>I will have to experiment.</u></p></font>
<font face="impact", size="6", color ="#5c8e6e"><p><b>For paragraph 2.</b> I am using the font element with the "hex code" color attribute.
I have chosen a<i> lovely</i> shade of green, #5c8e6e. When you use the dropper in Photoshop to choose a color,
it will also reveal the hex code for that color!</p></font>
